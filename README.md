# 🐪 Camel Up Leg Win Probability Simulator

This Python script simulates a single leg of the board game **Camel Up**, calculating the chances of each regular camel (red, blue, green, purple, yellow) winning the leg based on:

- The current board state
- Which camels have already rolled
- Any desert tiles on the track

The script runs 10,000 simulations of the remaining dice rolls and prints out the win probabilities.
